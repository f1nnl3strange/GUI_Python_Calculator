ChangeLog:

1. I cant see to be able to make the entry box work when you type something in so I've abandoned that

2. There is no delete key, only a clear one as I wasn't able to make it just delete one charcter not the whole equation

3. The 'MR' key from the design has changed to 'M' and the 'M-' key is now the 'MC' (Memory Clear) key.

4. The check to see if the calculation is invalid didn't work so I couldnt use it so if a calculation is invalid it just
   wont work.
   
5. The pseudocode I wrote in my design document has changed quite a bit, now instead of checking for function keys it takes
   whatever is enetred into the box and converts, that string into an integer and then just does the problem that way.
   
6. To refer to my entry box I've had to define a variable 'problem = StringVar()' at the start and in the setup of the entry
   define it as a textvariable so text can be sent to it in the form of the button presses.
   
7. Some of the varible names have changed due to change #5

8. All the variables are strings and then are being converted to integers using 'str(eval(variable_to_be_converted))'

9.
